## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS var()

### What I learned
- This is my first challenge in frontend mentor and my first practice with html and css. I watched a video as a guide first and then i tried to do it by myself. I had problems with the positioning stuffs and I had to go back to the reference video to figure it out, I have a lot to practice about it.
- If there is any suggestion, please let me know.


### Continued development

- I want to continue practicing on flexbox and position stuff, i'm struggling a little bit with that.
